WTF x IGDC Game Jam 2024 ðŸŽ®
This game was created as part of the IGDC Game Jam 2024.

You can play it on Itch.io â€” available in both WebGL and APK formats!

About the Experience
Our small team built this game over an intense weekend, staying in the office for two full days (Saturday and Sunday). We coded late into the night, sometimes waking up just to start working again â€” it was a true game jam spirit!

This was my first-ever game jam, and I absolutely loved the experience. It pushed our limits and brought out some of our best teamwork and creativity.
